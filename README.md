G00335783

In order to begin this python program, first you need to git clone this repository. You will need to run the python file named g00335783. The other files were just used as a practice for me to understand each problem individually. To run the file you will need to type "python g00335783.py" in the command prompt. Upon doing so you should see a number of results printing to the screen which are the test cases being run that are in the python code.

Shunting-Yard algorithm:
The shunting yard algorithm is a method for parsing Mathematical expressions in infix notation and converting it into a postfix notation. This algorithm uses stack to hold its operators where it will stack the operators based on its values. An infix notation is characterized by the placement of operators between infixed operators such as ".", "*" and "|".

Thompson's Construction:
Thompson's construction algorithm is a method of transforming a regular expression into an NFA which can then be used to match strings against the regular expression.
